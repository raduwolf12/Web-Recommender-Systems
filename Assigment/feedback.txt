Strong points:
- Clear and well written.
- The report is complete.

Suggestions and questions to address:
- Statistics and plot should be included in the report. It is not enough to mention that you did them.
- Please report statistics in tables, not in text.
- Please elaborate on ""from here comes the problem of creating a recommendation system that is not a biased"". 
What is the problem?
- Please elaborate on how the over-rating problem can impact accuracy.
- Please elaborate more on why user-based is a good choice.
- You might compute the sparsity measure to better justify your claims about sparsity 
[you are not required to so this but it might be useful to have that value].
- Why did you choose RMSE for hyper-parameter tuning and not measures such as HR, MRR, etc.?
- You need to briefly describe the models you implemented and their parameters. 
For example, what is ""min_support""?
- Elaborate on what you mean by RMSE assuming that all users give ratings in the same way.
- Please report the RMSE scores and hyper-parameters of your models in a table, not in text.
- Please report evaluation scores in a table, not in text.
- Some advantages and disadvantages of Precision@k and MAP@k are wrong.
- The reason why TopPop performs so well might be wrong.
- Some advantages and disadvantages of user-based CF and SVD are wrong.
